# Rust Mindset 

Programming is about tradeoffs, C values speed over safety and productivity. Python values productivity over speed. Rust values safety and speed.

## Programming Journey

## LOGO

At the age of 11 or 12 my mother took me to take a week course on programming, turns out it was LOGO, I enjoyed the abstraction concepts and having to imagine in your mind what is going to happen to the turtle once he will execute the instructions, those were like right 50, up 50, left 50, down 50 and you just draw a square!
I remember to have tried drawing more complex figures like a castle and it was a nightmare, first debug experience!

## Basic

I remember to have done some mathematical functions graphs in a basic program and also mathematica, it was the intro to programming. One of the first hard bugs to debug was having typed an example variable with a 1 instead of an l and seeing the compiler complaining of undeclared variable which seem to be declared just a line above.

## C

C was the first programming language intruduced to me in high school but really loved when used it a bit more serious in intro to computation at the university, I even spent my whole summer vacations playing with the compiler and making drawings and discovering special library functions.

## Perl

## Python
