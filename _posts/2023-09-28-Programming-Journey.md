# Rust Mindset 

Programming is about tradeoffs, C values speed over safety and productivity. Python values productivity over speed. Rust values safety and speed.

## Programming Journey

## LOGO

At the age of 11 my mother took me for a week into a programming course, turns out it was LOGO, I enjoyed the abstraction concepts and having to imagine in your mind what is going to happen to the turtle once he will execute the instructions, those were like right 50, up 50, left 50, down 50 and you just draw a square!
I remember to have tried drawing more complex figures like a castle and it was a nightmare, first debug experience!


## Basic

I remember to have done some mathematical functions graphs in a basic program and also mathematica, it was the intro to programming. One of the first hard bugs to debug was having typed an example variable with a 1 instead of an l and seeing the compiler complaining of undeclared variable which seem to be declared just a line above.

## C

C was the first programming language intruduced to me in high school but really loved when used it a bit more serious in intro to computation at the university, I even spent my whole summer vacations playing with the compiler and making drawings and discovering special library functions.

## Perl

I was introduced to Perl at university in an optional course about open source, in which Perl was used to parse text do file tests and small scripts which I found very intuitive to use and powerful. Using it at professional level lead me to realize how inconvenient and limited it was for doing big projects. It is called write only language for a reason.

## Python
I loved the simplicity and cleanliness of the python code, making indenting mandatory and actual part of the syntax was something very novel for me at the time.

## Rust
Having dealt a lot of time debugging memory errors, null pointers, leaking memory modules, etc. let me to be amazed by the promess of not having to deal with memory problems by simply using the language, which would better be stated as not having to deal with memory problems at runtime which means pushing these at compile time!
